OOP : 
- OOP stands as Object Oriented Programming.
- In this type programming the priority is given to the Object.
- In this bottom to up approach.
- ex. : JAVA, C++, etc.

Concept in OOP are listed below : 
1. Class
2. Object
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

1. Class : 
- Class is a blue print of the object.
- class also define as the combination of data member and member function.
   - Data member is a variable that defines in the class.
   - Member function is a user defined function that defines in class body.

2. Object :
- Object is a instance of the class that defines in main function for calling to those functions.
- for ex. : class name is such as First
          - in main body function is calling as First t1;
          - in this example the t1 is known as object of the class.

3.  Abstraction :
- Abstraction is use to hide the background data that not need to know for user.
- also we can say as the process of hiding the unnecessary data.

4. Encapsulation : 
- Encapsulation is use to wrap up the data which need sometime for user. 
- It is actually hidden but not as the Abstraction.

5. Inheritance : 
- Inheritance menas that the inherit the class which is already exist.
- Inheritance has five types that are listed below:
   1. Single Level Inheritance
      - In this type of Inheritance the only one parent derived class or we can say only one child class.
   2. Multi Level Inheritance
      - In this type of inheritance the class as Grand parent, parent and child class.
   3. Multiple Inheritance
      - In this type of inheritance there is multiple parent class but only one child class.
   4. Hirarchical Inheritance
      - In this type of inheritance the parent class has multiple child classes.
   5. Hybrid Inheritance
      - In this type of inheritance there is one grand parent class it has multiple child class and 
      multiple parent class and only one child class.

6. Polymorphism : 
- Polymorphism it simply one name many form.
- It has two types : 
   1. Overloading : 
      - It has two types :
      1. Function Overloading - same class and same name of function but parameter are differents.
      2. Operator overloading - it define using Operator keyword.
   2. Overridding : 
      1. Function Overridding - same name of function and same parameter but class are differents.
