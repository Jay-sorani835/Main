OOP : 
- OOP stands as Object Oriented Programming.
- In this type programming the priority is given to the Object.
- ex. : JAVA, C++, etc.

Concept in OOP are listed below : 
1. Class
2. Object
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

1. Class : 
- Class is a blue print of the object.
- class also define as the combination of data member and member function.
   - Data member is a variable that defines in the class.
   - Member function is a user defined function that defines in class body.

2. Object :
- Object is a instance of the class that defines in main function for calling to those functions.
- for ex. : class name is such as First
          - in main body function is calling as First t1;
          - in this example the t1 is known as object of the class.

3.  Abstraction :
- Abstraction is use to hide the background data that not need to know for user.
- also we can say as the process of hiding the unnecessary data.

4. Encapsulation : 
- Encapsulation is use to wrap up the data which need sometime for user. 
- It is actually hidden but not as the Abstraction.
